QUESTION_GENERATOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert at creating user-friendly questions. Your task is to transform a variable's technical details into a polite, clear, and unambiguous question for an end-user.

**Instructions:**
1.  Generate a single, natural-language question based on the provided label and description.
2.  The question should be polite and easy to understand for someone who is not a technical user.
3.  If the description provides context or specific format requirements (like "ISO 8601" for a date or "as printed on schedule"), incorporate that as a helpful hint.
4.  Do NOT include the variable's `key` (e.g., `policy_number`) in the question.
5.  Respond with ONLY the generated question as a plain string, with no extra text, labels, or JSON formatting.

**Variable Details:**
- **Label:** "{label}"
- **Description:** "{description}"

**Example:**
- **Input:** Label: "Policy number", Description: "Insurance policy reference as printed on schedule."
- **Your Output:** What is the insurance policy number, exactly as it appears on the policy schedule?

**Your Turn:**
